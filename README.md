Portfolio Projects

This repository contains my Portfolio Projects on various data analysis and data science topics â€” from python practice and data visualisation to machine learning and natural language processing.

### 5 Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means++): ["Masculinity Survey Insights"](./ml/unsupervised_learning/clustering_masculinity_survey.ipynb)

In this project, we will be investigating the way people think about masculinity by applying the **K-Means++** algorithm to data from  <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/" target = "_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a>. FiveThirtyEight is a popular website known for their use of statistical analysis in many of their stories.

### 4. NLP: ["Movie Reviews"](./nlp/nlp_portfolio_project.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to get insight into IMDB movie reviews on different layers using various NLP techniques and libraries. A dataset that we are going to use is meant mainly for **binary sentiment classification** and performing this particular type of analysis will, indeed, be our primary goal, but additionally, we'll **use POS tagging and chunking to find commonly used noun and verb phrases** and **find the most common movie topics users wrote about (topic modelling using LDA)**.

### 3. Statistical Analysis and Visualisation: ["Roller Coasters"](./analysis_and_visualisation/roller_coasters/roller_coaster.ipynb)
The goal of this project is visualizing data covering international roller coaster rankings and statistics.

-----------------------

### 2. pandas aggregation functions: ["Jeopardy Game"](./analysis_and_visualisation/jeopardy_game/jeopardy_project.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to investigate a dataset of "Jeopardy" game using pandas methods and write several aggregate functions to find some insights.

### 1. Python: ["Medical Insurance"](./python_practice/medical_insurance.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to analyze various attributes within **insurance.csv**, using python, to learn more about the patient information in the file and gain insight into potential use cases for the dataset.
