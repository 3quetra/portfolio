# Portfolio Projects

This repository contains my Portfolio Projects on various data analysis and data science topics â€” from python practice and data visualisation to machine learning and natural language processing.

### 9. EDA (Time-Series Data): ['Exploratory Analysis of Climate Data'](./ml/deep_learning/time_series/wids_datathon_2023/eda_temp_prediction.ipynb)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA for short) refers to the process of discovering patterns and relationships within a dataset. It is about making sense of the data at hand and getting to know it before modeling or analysis. It is an important step prior to model building and can help us formulate further questions and areas for investigation. Within this project we are going work with the `training_data.csv` and `test_data.csv` provided by partners of [WiDS Datathon 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2023/data). 

-----------------------


### 8. Deep Learning (RNNs & LSTMs): ['Temperature Forecast'](./ml/deep_learning/time_series/temp_prediction.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to compare performance of two deep learning algorithms on time-series data: Tensorflow's stacked layers of Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), using MAE and RMSE as evaluation metrics.

-----------------------

### 7. Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means++): ["Masculinity Survey Insights"](./ml/unsupervised_learning/clustering_masculinity_survey.ipynb)

In this project, we will be investigating the way people think about masculinity by applying the **K-Means++** algorithm to data from  <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/" target = "_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a>. FiveThirtyEight is a popular website known for their use of statistical analysis in many of their stories.

-----------------------

### 6. Supervised Machine Learning (Ensemble Technique): ["OKCupid Dating App"](./ml/supervised_learning/dating_app_profiles_analysis.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to find out whether it's possible to predict person's age and religious views via machine learning models, with sufficient accuracy, based on dating app profiles' data from OKCupid.  We are going to evaluate accuracy of different supervised models separately as well as create ensembles and assess resulting accuracy's shifts. Dataset is provided by Codecademy.com.

-----------------------

### 5. NLP: ["Movie Reviews"](./nlp/nlp_portfolio_project.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to get insight into IMDB movie reviews on different layers using various NLP techniques and libraries. A dataset that we are going to use is meant mainly for **binary sentiment classification** and performing this particular type of analysis will, indeed, be our primary goal, but additionally, we'll **use POS tagging and chunking to find commonly used noun and verb phrases** and **find the most common movie topics users wrote about (topic modelling using LDA)**. 

-----------------------

### 4. Statistical Analysis and Visualisation: ["Roller Coasters"](./statistics_and_visualisation/roller_coasters/roller_coaster.ipynb)
The goal of this project is visualizing data covering international roller coaster rankings and statistics.

-----------------------

### 3. pandas aggregation functions: ["Jeopardy Game"](./statistics_and_visualisation/jeopardy_game/jeopardy_project.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to investigate a dataset of "Jeopardy" game using pandas methods and write several aggregate functions to find some insights. 

-----------------------

### 2. SQL queries (SQLite): ["Marketing Data Analysis"](./sql/marketing_analysis.ipynb)

The goal of this project is getting customer related insights by:
- applying *usage funnel* marketing model;
- conducting A/B test;
- calculating one of the most important marketing metrics - *churn rate*;
- ascertaining *first- and last-touch attribution* sources; 

using SQL queries on different Codecademy.com datasets.

-----------------------

### 1. Python: ["Medical Insurance"](./python/medical_insurance.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to analyze various attributes within **insurance.csv**, using python, to learn more about the patient information in the file and gain insight into potential use cases for the dataset.
