This repository contains my Portfolio Projects on various data analysis and data science topics â€” from python practice and data visualisation to machine learning and natural language processing.


### 4. NLP: ["Movie Reviews"](./nlp/nlp_portfolio_project.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to get insight into IMDB movie reviews on different layers using various NLP techniques and libraries. A dataset that we are going to use is meant mainly for **binary sentiment classification** and performing this particular type of analysis will, indeed, be our primary goal, but additionally, we'll **use POS tagging and chunking to find commonly used noun and verb phrases** and **find the most common movie topics users wrote about (topic modelling using LDA)**.
