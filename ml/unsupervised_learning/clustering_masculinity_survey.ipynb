    "# Masculinity Survey Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be investigating the way people think about masculinity by applying the **K-Means++** algorithm to data from  <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/\" target = \"_blank\">FiveThirtyEight</a>. FiveThirtyEight is a popular website known for their use of statistical analysis in many of their stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The questions of the survey are stored in [masculinity-survey.pdf](masculinity-survey.pdf). FiveThirtyEight and WNYC studios used this survey to get their male readers' thoughts on masculinity. \n",
    "- Answers to those questions are stored in [masculinity.csv](masculinity.csv). \n",
    "- Major takeaways are printed in the FiveThirtyEight's article <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man/\" target = \"_blank\">What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?</a>.\n",

    "We're going to try to find these and other insights using machine learning clustering technique.\n",

    "## Data Investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, we'll take a look at `masculinity-survey.pdf` and then at FiveThirtyEight's article major takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Male Identity\n",
    "- `83%` of men said they felt “very” or “somewhat” masculine.\n",
    "- `53%` said it was very or somewhat important that others see them that way.\n",
    "- `64%` said father or a father figure was a source of their ideas about what it means to be a good man.\n",
    "- `41%` said that mothers came in second as a source of their ideas about what it means to be a good man. \n",
    "- Many also cited religion s a source.\n",
    "- There were generational differences. Pop culture was a source of inspiration for an understanding of manhood for younger men:\n",
    "    - `42%` of ages 18-34;\n",
    "    - `17%` of ages 35-64; \n",
    "    - `12%` of ages 65 and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Social Pressure\n",
    "- `60%` of men agreed that society puts pressure on men in a way that is unhealthy or bad. And the younger a man was, the more likely he was to believe that.\n",
    "\n",
    "- While most respondents were in agreement that society puts negative pressure on men, they differed on the form that pressure takes. One respondent said there are “too many **unnatural ‘macho’ expectations** and too little emphasis on nurturing skills,” while another believed there is “too much emphasis on finding our feelings.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Persistent Worries\n",
    "- Most men said they had some daily concerns, *weight* and *finances* chief among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Being a Man at Work\n",
    "- `23%` said men are taken more seriously than women at work. But most suggested that there were no advantages to be had.\n",
    "- `42%` said men are at a greater risk of being accused of sexual harassment.\n",
    "- Nearly a quarter of the respondents who were employed said they hadn’t heard of #MeToo.\n",
    "- Among `77%` of those who were familiar with #MeToo movement, 1 in 3 said they thought about their behavior at work differently as a result.\n",
    "- Three-quarters said they had never been witness to a sexual harassment at work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dating and Relationships\n",
    "- `61%` of men said they felt as though it was expected of them to make the first move in romantic relationships.\n",
    "- `49%` said they always tried to pay when on dates. Younger men, however, were less likely to pay for their dates than their older counterparts with `12%` of those in ages 18-34 saying they never try to grab the check first.\n",
    "- `86%` said they had not changed their behavior in romantic relationships in the wake of #MeToo.\n",
    "- `31%` said they ask for verbal consent when they want to be physically intimate with someone.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind let's start our own investigation. We'll start with necessary imports and data loading. "
