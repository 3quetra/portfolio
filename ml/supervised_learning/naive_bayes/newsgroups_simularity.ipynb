    "We are going to use 20 newsgroups dataset which, according to documentation, comprises around 18000 newsgroups posts on 20 topics split in two subsets: one for training (or development) and the other one for testing (or for performance evaluation). The split between the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before and after a specific date. Documentation also says that it is easy for any classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the 20 Newsgroups data. Many classifiers achieve very high F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that aren’t from this window of time. For this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a parameter called `remove`, telling it what kinds of information to strip out of each file. We are going to remove headers, signature blocks, and quotation blocks, as recommended by documentation, to get more realistic results. \n",
