    "# Movie Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyse IMDB movie review texts using various NLP techniques and libraries. A dataset that we are going to use is meant mainly for **binary sentiment classification** and performing this particular type of analysis will, indeed, be our primary goal, but additionally, we'll **use POS tagging and chunking to find commonly used noun and verb phrases** and **find the most common movie topics users wrote about (topic modelling using LDA)**. All these techniques should give us insights into review texts on different levels as well as give us a new model to perform topic modelling on similar datasets as well as a sentiment analysis model to identify positive or negative reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to authors of this dataset it contains substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. They provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. In this regard, I respectfully would like to draw your attention to their research paper: [Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis](https://aclanthology.org/P11-1015) (Maas et al., ACL 2011)\n",

    "Let's import necessary libraries and methods crucial for further work and look at our dataset. We are going to upload data via `pandas` to see if it would facilitate further analysis."

This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.</td>\n",

As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.   \n",

Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.   \n",

If you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest, I suggest you discard your critical<span style='color:red;'>-</span>mindedness and your longing for a good plot because you won't find any in here. With that established, let us further into the movie.I had low expectations for this movie simply because it didn't have a strong plot(Yes, moviegoers, I underrated this movie as well), but I never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much. I even enjoyed this more than the Stephen Chow flicks(which I find Kung Fu Hustle to be his best effort and would've rated it a 9 as well). Action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right places.SPOILERS alert, I think The action might be unreal, but why would I want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways? There are a lot other sports movies(drama) that already did it well, why create another? SPOILERS endI'm not even sure why you're reading this. Go ahead and watch it. Just remember, no thinking <span style='color:red;'>-</span> just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh, and Every once in a while they(the movie industry) creates masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction or The Godfather movies, and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump.

We can see that there is some word overlap between topics, others are hard to interpret, and most of them have at least some terms that seem out of place.

We already know about the Multiverse, but Marvel is constantly pushing this concept which was introduced for the first time in \"Doctor Strange\" back in 2016. It started to be old and repetitive. I have to admit that the TVA storyline is interesting but it is watered down in six episodes. The show is slow, there are a lot of empty moments where the story does not progress. Honestly they could have done a movie for Disney +, and it would be way more entertaining and less time consuming for the audience. A potentially good preamble for \"Multiverse of Madness\". There are interesting ideas, such as different Lokis, from different timelines. It was genuinely funny, but I don't like what they have done with the main characters. The God of Mischief, that was always an interesting depiction of hero/villain duality, here seems more like a scared child that does not know how to use his powers. The entire wannabe love story between him and Sylvie could have been completely cut out. Creators wanted to add too much to the plate, instead of keeping things simple and straightforward. Hence, the show, at least for me, is very chaotic and lacks vision. Action sequences are completely censored. There is no blood and no bruises, even though the characters are beating the hell out of each other. I do not understand why Disney made this childish decision, considering that in \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" and in \"Black Widow\" there are some strong and explicit images. Moreover, action sequences are bland and definitely not up to Marvel standards. However, cinematography and special effects are amazing. Owen Wilson basically carried this show alone; the other actors are nowhere close to his level, not even Tom Hiddleston. I mean, the rest of the cast is composed by skillful people, but the gap is very noticeable. If in a series titled after the God of Outcasts, the only character that can grab my undivided attention is Mobius, there were clearly big issues somewhere along the way. If I gave this show four stars out of ten, it is only because of his performance. Once again Marvel and Disney think that throwing tons of money down the pipe for production design, visual effects and marketing is good enough to make an entertaining show. If you do not focus on an interesting plot and if you keep pushing for forced comedy, you'll end up with a pretty average product that cannot stand out. If the first season of this show is already so weak, I am really worried about the second one.</td>\n",

Surprisingly, I find Ryder's acting to be the most irritating out of anyone's in the cast. She strikes me as shrill, with very little nuance. I think the series would be much better without her.</td>\n",

I couldn't continue to watch Season 5, because there were too many events which always at the last moment something happened which they're really illogical things \"like the traditional Indian movies\"! Especially in the war against Changretta, in many occasions the Italian could kill Thomas easily but they don't! Like they want to play games not War! And they're waiting for him to kill them.

       "      <td>Ms. Marvel started very well, we all were connecting to Kamala, her love for a superhero, dreaming fiction, it was all relatable. So, I thought this show would be fun to watch. It's really a fun series, but it suffered the same way Multiverse of Madness suffered - the villain plot. I didn't like that whole clandestine storyline, the reasons mentioned were not enough for their doings. So, writing was not that good. I didn't understand the concept of time travel here as I think it's not easy to show paradox in any MCU project. Now, the final episode was so childish, it would've been good if it finished in episode 5. Among the actors I loved our bollywood actors the most. Mohan Kapur's Yusuf Khan is my favourite character from the show. Farhan Akhtar in his short screen time got some cool action scenes and he did it very well. Fawad Khan along with Mehwish Hayat shined very well. Many were criticising Iman Vellani's portrayal of Ms. Marvel but I think she is perfect for this role. Overall, it was a OKAY series.</td>\n",

The Blip raised a lot of dark things that superheros had to face now on. They brought into picture some real deep questions about the day to day life of superheros and genuine issues about their livelihood, Blip victims' livelihood and those who survived through the crisis in these 5 years.

Season 2, on the other hand, completes forgets that the point of any story should be the plot, and focuses instead on just coming up with reasons to insert gore and violence that do not advance the plot in any tangible way. There may be a good story that you could find in season 2, if you dig down. But they cover it up with gratuitous and utterly unnecessary gore. Plenty of shows and movies have copious amounts of violence, yet still remain loyal to putting the plot first. This is not one of those. Why? Just, why?   \n",

This garbage has nothing to do with the Starwars canon where Obiwan is great protector of a great cause, not the nitwit loser, going against his will to rescue one of the key figures in the StarWars universe, that is portrayed in this dumpster fire. No decant story line, not fitting in canon (have the writers even watch and understood the original series? Totally dragged out plot. Mandalorian took a fresh watchable approach? But this pile of junk is unwatchable. This series is totally unwatchable and leaves me hurt and said... What are they thinking @Disney. Just an other cash cow, and trying to cheapskate is? I don't think so. This is one of the moments that I wish I could give minus points. May the force be with you, when you try to watch this abomination, you will need it....   \n",

Didn't need to be a generic end of the world plot for the first season. The finale was like somebody watched Gods of Egypt and said \"Let's do this again but, much worse\". Easily the weakest of the Disney+ Marvel shows, just edging out The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Some things work well stretched across a longer runtime but something like this just doesn't. There was like 90 minutes of actual story. The action was rubbish and they just have him black out constantly like \"I wonder whats happening? Is it Jake?\" but its just to save money on choreography or whatever. Its just incredibly bland from beginning to end. A real shame.   \n",
       "3  I think that \"Loki\" was badly written and executed, and does not add much to the MCU. We already know about the Multiverse, but Marvel is constantly pushing this concept which was introduced for the first time in \"Doctor Strange\" back in 2016. It started to be old and repetitive. I have to admit that the TVA storyline is interesting but it is watered down in six episodes. The show is slow, there are a lot of empty moments where the story does not progress. Honestly they could have done a movie for Disney +, and it would be way more entertaining and less time consuming for the audience. A potentially good preamble for \"Multiverse of Madness\". There are interesting ideas, such as different Lokis, from different timelines. It was genuinely funny, but I don't like what they have done with the main characters. The God of Mischief, that was always an interesting depiction of hero/villain duality, here seems more like a scared child that does not know how to use his powers. The entire wannabe love story between him and Sylvie could have been completely cut out. Creators wanted to add too much to the plate, instead of keeping things simple and straightforward. Hence, the show, at least for me, is very chaotic and lacks vision. Action sequences are completely censored. There is no blood and no bruises, even though the characters are beating the hell out of each other. I do not understand why Disney made this childish decision, considering that in \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" and in \"Black Widow\" there are some strong and explicit images. Moreover, action sequences are bland and definitely not up to Marvel standards. However, cinematography and special effects are amazing. Owen Wilson basically carried this show alone; the other actors are nowhere close to his level, not even Tom Hiddleston. I mean, the rest of the cast is composed by skillful people, but the gap is very noticeable. If in a series titled after the God of Outcasts, the only character that can grab my undivided attention is Mobius, there were clearly big issues somewhere along the way. If I gave this show four stars out of ten, it is only because of his performance. Once again Marvel and Disney think that throwing tons of money down the pipe for production design, visual effects and marketing is good enough to make an entertaining show. If you do not focus on an interesting plot and if you keep pushing for forced comedy, you'll end up with a pretty average product that cannot stand out. If the first season of this show is already so weak, I am really worried about the second one.   \n",

A pretty solid, average score of 5. Surprisingly, I find Ryder's acting to be the most irritating out of anyone's in the cast. She strikes me as shrill, with very little nuance. I think the series would be much better without her.   \n",

I couldn't continue to watch Season 5, because there were too many events which always at the last moment something happened which they're really illogical things \"like the traditional Indian movies\"! Especially in the war against Changretta, in many occasions the Italian could kill Thomas easily but they don't! Like they want to play games not War! And they're waiting for him to kill them. Respect for this Series' lovers, and also respect to Indian for mentioning their movies.   \n",

So, I thought this show would be fun to watch. It's really a fun series, but it suffered the same way Multiverse of Madness suffered - the villain plot. I didn't like that whole clandestine storyline, the reasons mentioned were not enough for their doings. So, writing was not that good. I didn't understand the concept of time travel here as I think it's not easy to show paradox in any MCU project. Now, the final episode was so childish, it would've been good if it finished in episode 5. Among the actors I loved our bollywood actors the most. Mohan Kapur's Yusuf Khan is my favourite character from the show. Farhan Akhtar in his short screen time got some cool action scenes and he did it very well. Fawad Khan along with Mehwish Hayat shined very well. Many were criticising Iman Vellani's portrayal of Ms. Marvel but I think she is perfect for this role. Overall, it was a OKAY series.   \n",

All of the movies in this series look amazing.   \n",

But what in my opinion raises it above the already good series is the use of music in the movie. Remarkable, impressive, needs to recognized with an award. It's been years (pulp fiction?) since I saw such a perfect use of music for the last time!   \n",

The Blip raised a lot of dark things that superheros had to face now on. They brought into picture some real deep questions about the day to day life of superheros and genuine issues about their livelihood, Blip victims' livelihood and those who survived through the crisis in these 5 years. And the action sequences were groundbreaking as always. Really a excellent job by mcu and it was really a mind-provoking experience. Just loved it.   \n",
