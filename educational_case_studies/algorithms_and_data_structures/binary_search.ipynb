    "# Optimizing Chocolate Sharing with Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problem: Sharing a chocolate bar fairly among 11 people.\n",
    "- Objective: Maximize the sweetness of the piece with minimal sweetness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short [**presentation**](Optimizing%20Chocolate%20Sharing%20with%20Binary%20Search.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have one chocolate bar that consists of some chunks. Each chunk has its own sweetness given by the array sweetness.\n",
    "We want to share the chocolate with our 11 (`num_of_people`) group mates,  so we start cutting the chocolate bar into 11  (`num_of_people`) pieces using 10 (`num_of_people-1`) cuts, each piece consists of some consecutive chunks.\n",
    "We will divide the pieces randomly, but someone will get a piece with the minimum total sweetness. We don't want to create an unfair cut, so we want to maximize the sweetness of such a piece, or in other words: find the maximum availible total sweetness for a peace with minimal sweetness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use binary search to solve this problem.\n",
    "We start by initializing low boundary to be the minimum element in sweetness (can't get a piece less sweet, than the chunk with minimum sweetness) and high to be `sum(sweetness) / (num_of_people - 1)`. If we take 91 as a total sweetness of our the bar, then we can't divide 91 into 11 pieces and get more than 4 of maximum availible total sweetness.\n",
    "Each time we calculate mid to be the average of  low and high and check whether it is possible to cut the chocolate bar into `num_of_people - 1` pieces such, that each piece has total sweetness at least mid. If so, update the maximum availible total sweetness using mid and set `low = mid + 1`. Otherwise, set `high = mid - 1`. Finally, return the maximum availible total sweetness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by implementing binary search algorithm. "
