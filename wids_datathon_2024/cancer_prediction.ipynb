    "### Covariates\n",
    "For this datathon challenge, we are using a real-world evidence dataset from Health Verity (HV), one of the largest healthcare data ecosystems in the US, as the main data source for the Datathon. In particular, the HV dataset that we use for this challenge contains health related information of patients who were diagnosed with metastatic triple negative breast cancers in the US. We also enriched the data set with the US Zip Codes Database which were built from the ground up using authoritative sources including the U.S. Postal Service™, U.S. Census Bureau, National Weather Service, American Community Survey, and the IRS, to obtain additional social economic information based on the locations of the patients. The dataset was then further enriched, also using zip code level, with toxicology data from NASA/Columbia University, to explore the relations between health outcomes and toxic air conditions.\n",
